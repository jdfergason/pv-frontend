        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Penny Vault is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors. Our Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our web site.</p>

        <h3>Collection of Information</h3>
        <p>We collect "Non-Personal Information" and "Personal Information." Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous site usage data and platform information provided by your browser including your Internet Protocol address, device and browser types and identifiers, and referring web page address. Personal Information includes your email address, which you provide to us during the registration process, along with any models, data series, and configuration settings you optionally choose to save with your registered account. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use your email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>Use of Information</h3>
        <p>We use Non-Personal Information such as anonymous site usage data and platform information to help us improve the web site. When you register and provide your personal information, we use this information to personalize your experience so that you save and retrieve your portfolio and other models you configure on the site.</p>

        <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

        <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>This website uses cookies. A cookie is a small file that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The information contained in the cookie is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. We use persistent cookies to recognize your browser and capture Non-Personal Information on site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer a better site experience and tools in the future. In addition, we use session cookies to keep track of registered users' authenticated web sessions. If you configure your browser to block cookies, you will be unable to use the areas of the website that require registration.</p>

        <h3>Analytics Providers</h3>
        <p>We may use third-party web analytics services in connection with the site, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the site. The information collected (described above in "Non-Personal Information") will be collected directly by these service providers to evaluate your use of the site.</p>

        <h3>Your Rights Over Your Data</h3>
        <p>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time or request that we delete data associated with your account.</p>

        <h3>Data Retention</h3>
        <p>For users that register on our website, we store the personal information they provide in their user profile. Users can see, edit, or delete their personal account information at any time. The information may still be retained in historical data backups.</p>

        <h3>Protecting Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as "Personal Information"), that information is transmitted to us securely by encrypting the data before transmission, authenticating the endpoint, and decrypting and verifying the data on arrival. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers on which we store personally identifiable information are provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers in the US, and we further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including data and network traffic encryption, firewalls, multi-factor authentication, and strict access control policies. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using this web site, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>

        <h3>Third Party Websites</h3>
        <p>Our website includes hyperlinks to third party websites. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain.</p>

        <h3>Your Consent</h3>
        <p>By using our site, you consent to this privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy and our Terms of Service at any time. If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. You should periodically check this privacy policy page for updates.</p>

        <p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy or feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you can contact us with any questions or concerns at webmaster@pennyvault.com.</p>
